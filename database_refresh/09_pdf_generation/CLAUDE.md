# Stage 09: PDF Generation

## Overview
This stage generates professionally formatted PDF documents from the processed earnings transcript data (Stage 7 paragraph-level output with summaries). Each transcript is converted into a structured PDF with intelligent layout, smart paragraph placement, and comprehensive headers/footers.

**Input**: `Finance Data and Analytics/DSA/Earnings Call Transcripts/Outputs/Refresh/stage_07_summarized_content.json`
**Output**: `Finance Data and Analytics/DSA/Earnings Call Transcripts/Outputs/Refresh/stage_09_pdfs/*.pdf`

Architecture follows Stage 7/8 patterns with NAS operations, error logging, and batch processing.

## Key Features
- **Professional Layout**: Clean, structured PDF with title page and section breaks
- **Smart Paragraph Placement**: Prevents paragraph splitting at page boundaries
- **Speaker Block Grouping**: Keeps speaker content together when possible
- **Section Organization**: Separate Management Discussion and Q&A sections
- **Headers/Footers**: Dynamic headers with title and section, footers with metadata
- **Page Breaks**: Strategic breaks between major sections for readability
- **KeepTogether Logic**: Intelligent grouping of related content blocks
- **Batch Processing**: Efficient processing of multiple transcripts

## PDF Structure

### 1. Title Page
- Transcript title (full earnings call title)
- Bank/Company name
- Ticker symbol
- Fiscal Year and Quarter details

### 2. Management Discussion Section
- Section header: "Management Discussion"
- Speaker blocks containing:
  - Speaker name (bold, indented)
  - Paragraph content (justified, indented)
- Smart grouping to keep speakers with their content

### 3. Q&A Section (new page)
- Section header: "Questions & Answers"  
- Q&A blocks containing:
  - Q&A block header (e.g., "Q&A Block 1")
  - Speaker blocks within each Q&A group
  - Proper indentation hierarchy

### 4. Headers and Footers
**Header (all pages)**:
- Left: Title (truncated) | Section name
- Right: Page number

**Footer (all pages)**:
- Left: Bank | FYxxxx Qx
- Right: Page number

## Layout Features

### Smart Paragraph Placement
- Analyzes paragraph length before page boundaries
- Moves entire paragraphs to next page if split would occur
- Maintains readability by avoiding awkward breaks

### KeepTogether Strategy
- Speaker name always stays with first paragraph
- Short speaker blocks (≤3 paragraphs) kept together
- Q&A blocks kept together if reasonable size (≤8 elements)
- Prevents orphaned headers at page bottom

### Professional Styling
- **Title**: 24pt, centered, dark gray
- **Subtitles**: 14pt, centered, medium gray
- **Section Headers**: 18pt, left-aligned, dark blue
- **Q&A Headers**: 14pt, slightly indented
- **Speaker Names**: 12pt, bold, indented
- **Content**: 11pt, justified, properly indented
- **Headers/Footers**: 9pt, gray

## Usage

### Basic Execution
```bash
cd database_refresh/09_pdf_generation
python main_pdf_generation.py
```

The script will:
1. Connect to NAS using environment variables
2. Load configuration from NAS
3. Download Stage 8 output (CSV or JSON)
4. Group records by transcript
5. Generate PDF for each transcript
6. Upload PDFs to NAS
7. Save execution and error logs

## Configuration
Configuration is loaded from NAS at runtime from `config.yaml`:

```yaml
stage_09_pdf_generation:
  description: "Generate PDF documents from Stage 8 embeddings data"
  input_data_path: "Finance Data and Analytics/DSA/Earnings Call Transcripts/Outputs/Refresh/stage_08_embeddings.csv"
  output_data_path: "Finance Data and Analytics/DSA/Earnings Call Transcripts/Outputs/Refresh"
  output_logs_path: "Finance Data and Analytics/DSA/Earnings Call Transcripts/Outputs/Logs"
  dev_mode: true
  dev_max_transcripts: 5
  
  # PDF generation configuration
  pdf_config:
    page_size: "letter"  # letter or A4
    margins: 1.0  # inches
    font_family: "Helvetica"
    include_embeddings: false  # Don't include embeddings in PDF
    include_summaries: false  # Don't include AI summaries
    max_pages_per_pdf: 500  # Safety limit
```

### Authentication & NAS Access

**Environment Variables Required**:
- `NAS_SHARE_NAME`: NAS share name
- `NAS_USER`: NAS username
- `NAS_PASSWORD`: NAS password
- `NAS_DOMAIN`: NAS domain (optional)

**Features**:
- Direct NAS connection for file operations
- Automatic directory creation for output
- Incremental upload as PDFs are generated

## Output Structure

### PDF Files
Each PDF is named based on the original transcript:
```
ticker_quarter_year_transcripttype_eventid_versionid.pdf
```

Example: `AAPL_Q1_2024_earnings_call_evt123_v1.pdf`

### PDF Content Organization
```
Page 1: Title Page
  - Title
  - Company/Bank
  - Ticker
  - Fiscal Period

Page 2+: Management Discussion
  - Section Header
  - Speaker Block 1
    - Speaker Name
    - Paragraphs
  - Speaker Block 2
    ...

Page N: Q&A Section (after page break)
  - Section Header
  - Q&A Block 1
    - Q&A Header
    - Speaker 1
      - Paragraphs
    - Speaker 2
      - Paragraphs
  - Q&A Block 2
    ...
```

## Error Handling

### Error Categories
- **PDF Generation Errors**: Issues creating the PDF document
- **Formatting Errors**: Problems with content formatting
- **Processing Errors**: Issues processing transcript data
- **Validation Errors**: Invalid or missing required fields

### Error Logging
Each error is logged with:
- Ticker/transcript identifier
- Error type and message
- Detailed context
- Timestamp

### Recovery Strategy
- Continue processing remaining transcripts on error
- Log all failures for review
- Save partial results when possible
- Detailed error reports saved to NAS

## Performance Considerations

### Memory Management
- Process transcripts one at a time
- Clear temporary files after upload
- Efficient reportlab streaming

### Batch Processing
- Configurable batch sizes
- Dev mode limits for testing
- Progress logging every 10 transcripts

### PDF Optimization
- Efficient paragraph grouping
- Minimal style definitions
- Compressed PDF output

## Dependencies
```bash
pip install pyyaml
pip install pysmb
pip install python-dotenv
pip install reportlab
```

### ReportLab Features Used
- `SimpleDocTemplate`: Main document structure
- `Paragraph`: Text content with styling
- `PageBreak`: Section separation
- `KeepTogether`: Smart content grouping
- `Spacer`: Vertical spacing control
- Custom header/footer callbacks

## Next Steps
The PDFs generated in this stage enable:
1. Professional document distribution
2. Archival and compliance storage
3. Print-ready earnings transcript reports
4. Executive briefing materials
5. Training data visualization for ML models

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Large Transcript Handling**
   - PDFs may exceed max_pages_per_pdf limit
   - Solution: Increase limit in config or split transcript

2. **Special Characters**
   - Some financial symbols may not render correctly
   - Solution: Content is escaped for XML/HTML compatibility

3. **Memory Issues**
   - Very large batches may consume significant memory
   - Solution: Reduce dev_max_transcripts or process in smaller batches

4. **Upload Failures**
   - NAS connection timeouts on large files
   - Solution: Script includes retry logic and saves locally first

### Validation
To validate PDF generation:
```python
# Check if all transcripts have PDFs
import os
from pathlib import Path

# List Stage 8 transcripts
stage8_files = set(...)  # Load from Stage 8 output

# List generated PDFs
pdf_files = set(...)  # Load from stage_09_pdfs directory

# Find missing
missing = stage8_files - pdf_files
print(f"Missing PDFs: {len(missing)}")
```

## Best Practices

1. **Development Testing**
   - Always test with dev_mode first
   - Start with 5-10 transcripts
   - Verify PDF quality before full run

2. **Production Runs**
   - Monitor first 100 PDFs for quality
   - Check error logs regularly
   - Verify NAS space availability

3. **Quality Assurance**
   - Spot-check PDFs from different companies
   - Verify all sections present
   - Confirm headers/footers correct
   - Test PDF searchability
