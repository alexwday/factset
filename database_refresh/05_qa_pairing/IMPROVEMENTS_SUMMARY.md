# Stage 5 Q&A Pairing Visualization Improvements

## Issues Fixed

### 1. MD Section Stats Showing 0 Words
**Problem**: The Management Discussion (MD) section statistics were showing 0 words because the code was only checking for `section == "Management Discussion"` but Stage 4/5 data may use either "Management Discussion" or "MD" as the section name.

**Fix**: Updated the section checking logic to handle both possible values:
```python
# Check for both possible section names from Stage 4
if section == "Management Discussion" or section == "MD":
    management_words += block_words
```

### 2. Missing Speaker Block Breakdown in MD Section
**Problem**: The MD section visualization wasn't showing speaker-level breakdown in the progress bars.

**Fix**: 
- Modified the segment consolidation logic to properly handle both section names
- Already had speaker consolidation logic, but it wasn't working due to the section name mismatch
- Now properly consolidates consecutive MD blocks by speaker (Executives, Operator)

### 3. Enhanced Analytics and Features

#### Added MD Speaker Breakdown Section
- New summary section showing word count and block count for each speaker in MD sections
- Sorted by total words to highlight primary speakers
- Helps identify conversation flow patterns

#### Improved Section Name Handling
- Updated all references to check for both "Management Discussion" and "MD"
- Ensures compatibility with different Stage 4 output formats

#### Enhanced Visual Elements
- MD blocks now show speaker names (abbreviated as "Exec" or "Op" for space)
- Block ranges displayed for consolidated segments (e.g., "blocks 1-5")
- Professional bank-inspired color scheme maintained

## Technical Details

### Key Functions Updated:
1. `analyze_transcript_structure()` - Fixed section name checking for word counting
2. `generate_transcript_bar()` - Fixed MD segment consolidation logic
3. Added MD speaker statistics collection and display

### Data Compatibility:
- The visualization now handles both possible section naming conventions from Stage 4
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing data formats
- Properly counts words and tracks speakers across all MD content

## Usage Notes
- The visualization will now correctly show MD section statistics
- Speaker breakdown provides insights into who dominates the prepared remarks
- All MD content is properly visualized with speaker-level granularity
