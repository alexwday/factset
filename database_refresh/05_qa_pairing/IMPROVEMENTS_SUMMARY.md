# Stage 5 Q&A Pairing - Code Improvements Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Removed Excessive Debug Logging**
- Removed verbose prompt logging (lines 1089-1106, 1118-1128, 1258-1282)
- Removed extensive DEBUG logging in `apply_qa_assignments_to_records()` (lines 1697-1782)
- Simplified window processing status logs
- Removed all decorative emojis from log messages
- Kept only essential operational logging

### 2. **Fixed Infinite Loop Vulnerability**
- Added enhanced loop protection with position tracking
- Implemented stuck position detection (force advance after 3 iterations at same position)
- Increased max iterations from 2x to 3x speaker blocks for retry allowance
- Added early termination conditions

### 3. **Added Memory Limits**
- Added `max_held_blocks` configuration (default: 50) to prevent unbounded memory growth
- Force creates QA group when held blocks would exceed limit
- Resets held blocks to current window when memory limit reached

### 4. **Improved OAuth Token Management**
- Added retry logic with exponential backoff (3 attempts)
- Better error handling for network vs other failures
- Proper error tracking in stage summary when OAuth fails
- Per-transcript token refresh maintained

### 5. **Enhanced Error Handling**
- Replaced generic `except Exception` with specific exception types
- Added network-specific error handling (ConnectionError, Timeout)
- Better error categorization (data_error, network, unexpected)
- Improved error context in logs

### 6. **Added Configuration Parameters**
- `window_size`: Number of speaker blocks to analyze (default: 10)
- `max_held_blocks`: Memory limit for accumulated blocks (default: 50)
- `max_consecutive_skips`: Skip limit before forcing breakpoint (default: 5)
- `max_validation_retries_per_position`: Validation retry limit (default: 2)

### 7. **Code Cleanup**
- Removed unused comments about legacy validation
- Fixed log file naming (removed duplicate "pairing")
- Optimized `format_speaker_block_content()` to avoid unnecessary concatenation
- Added documentation header for configuration parameters

## Key Algorithm Improvements

### Consecutive Skip Protection
- Tracks consecutive skip decisions
- Forces QA group creation after 5 consecutive skips
- Prevents algorithm from indefinitely skipping

### Memory Management
- Monitors held blocks accumulation
- Creates QA groups proactively when approaching limits
- Prevents out-of-memory conditions on large transcripts

### Robustness
- Better handling of edge cases
- Graceful degradation with confidence scores
- Maintains data integrity even when LLM calls fail

## Performance Optimizations
- Reduced string concatenation in logging
- Early termination for preview generation
- Removed redundant operations

## Maintainability
- Clear configuration parameters with defaults
- Better error messages for debugging
- Consistent naming conventions
- Removed confusing emoji decorations
