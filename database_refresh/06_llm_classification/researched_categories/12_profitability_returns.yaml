    When classifying content as Profitability & Returns:
    
    CORE IDENTIFICATION:
    1. Look for EARNINGS and RETURN metrics
    2. Key metrics: ROE, ROA, ROTCE, EPS, net income
    3. Bottom-line performance measures
    4. Return on invested capital discussions
    5. Overall financial performance assessment
    
    KEY COMPONENTS:
    6. Returns: ROE, ROA, ROTCE, ROIC
    7. Earnings: Net income, adjusted earnings, PPNR
    8. Per Share: EPS, BVPS, TBVPS
    9. Margins: Net margin, operating margin
    10. Growth: Earnings growth, EPS growth
    
    CRITICAL METRICS:
    - ROE = Net Income / Equity
    - ROA = Net Income / Assets
    - ROTCE = Net Income / Tangible Common Equity
    - EPS = Net Income / Shares
    - PPNR = Revenue - Expenses (before provisions)
    
    RETURN TARGETS:
    US Banks typical:
    - ROE: 12-18%
    - ROTCE: 15-20%
    - ROA: 1.0-1.5%
    
    Canadian Banks typical:
    - ROE: 15-18%
    - Adjusted ROE focus
    - Through-the-cycle targets
    
    QUALITY INDICATORS:
    - Sustainable vs one-time
    - Diversified vs concentrated
    - Stable vs volatile
    - Core vs non-core
    - Adjusted vs reported
    
    DRIVERS OF RETURNS:
    1. Revenue growth (positive)
    2. Expense control (positive)
    3. Credit costs (negative)
    4. Capital efficiency (positive)
    5. Tax rate (negative)
    
    GEOGRAPHIC DIFFERENCES:
    US BANKS:
    - ROTCE often preferred over ROE
    - PPNR emphasized
    - Stress test impacts
    
    CANADIAN BANKS:
    - Adjusted earnings common
    - Operating leverage linked
    - Items of note excluded
    - Constant currency adjustments
    
    PER SHARE METRICS:
    - EPS = Earnings per share
    - BVPS = Book value per share
    - TBVPS = Tangible book value per share
    - DPS = Dividends per share (different category)
    
    EXCLUSIONS:
    - Revenue details alone
    - Expense details alone
    - Capital ratios (CET1, etc.)
    - Credit provisions detail
    - Dividend yield (capital return)
    
    REMEMBER:
    - This is about BOTTOM LINE performance
    - Returns measure efficiency of capital use
    - Quality matters as much as quantity
    - Targets and trends important
    - Both absolute ($) and relative (%) metrics
