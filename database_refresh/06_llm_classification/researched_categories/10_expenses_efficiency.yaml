    When classifying content as Expenses & Efficiency:
    
    CORE IDENTIFICATION:
    1. Look for OPERATING EXPENSE and COST discussion
    2. Key metrics: Expenses, efficiency ratio, operating leverage
    3. Cost management and control initiatives
    4. Productivity and efficiency improvements
    5. Both absolute costs AND efficiency metrics
    
    KEY COMPONENTS:
    6. Operating Expenses: All non-interest, non-provision costs
    7. Efficiency Ratio: Expenses / Revenue (lower is better)
    8. Operating Leverage: Revenue growth - Expense growth
    9. Cost Categories: Comp, tech, occupancy, other
    10. Cost Programs: Savings, restructuring, optimization
    
    EXPENSE CATEGORIES:
    - Compensation and benefits (largest)
    - Technology and equipment
    - Occupancy and premises
    - Professional services
    - Marketing
    - Other operating
    
    EFFICIENCY METRICS:
    - Efficiency Ratio = Expenses/Revenue
    - Operating Leverage = Revenue growth > Expense growth
    - Compensation Ratio = Comp/Revenue
    - Productivity = Revenue/FTE or Expenses/FTE
    
    GEOGRAPHIC DIFFERENCES:
    US BANKS:
    - "Noninterest expense"
    - "Overhead ratio" sometimes
    - Efficiency ratio targets 50-60%
    
    CANADIAN BANKS:
    - "NIX" (non-interest expense)
    - "Operating leverage" emphasized
    - "Efficiency ratio (TEB)"
    - Positive operating leverage target
    
    COST MANAGEMENT:
    - Restructuring and severance
    - Branch optimization
    - Digital transformation (investment and savings)
    - Automation and AI
    - Vendor management
    - Real estate consolidation
    
    INVESTMENT VS BAU:
    - BAU = Business as usual/run-rate
    - Investments = Growth/transformation
    - Regulatory = Required compliance
    - Discretionary = Variable/optional
    
    EXCLUSIONS:
    - Credit provisions (separate category)
    - Interest expense (part of NII)
    - Trading losses
    - Income taxes
    - Preferred dividends
    
    REMEMBER:
    - This is about OPERATIONAL costs
    - Efficiency matters as much as absolute level
    - Operating leverage is key metric
    - Balance between investing and saving
    - Technology is both investment and efficiency driver
