  prompt_guidance_for_llm: |
    When classifying content as Trading & Markets:
    
    CORE IDENTIFICATION:
    1. Look for MARKET-MAKING and CLIENT FACILITATION activities
    2. FICC = Fixed Income, Currencies & Commodities
    3. Equities = Cash equities and equity derivatives
    4. Trading is FLOW business (client-driven) not proprietary positions
    5. Includes prime brokerage and securities lending
    
    KEY DIFFERENTIATORS:
    6. Trading = spread capture and facilitation (not fees)
    7. Different from IB = IB charges fees, trading captures spreads
    8. Mark-to-market accounting (not accrual like loans)
    9. Volatility generally HELPS trading (more activity, wider spreads)
    10. VAR (Value at Risk) indicates trading exposure
    
    CANADIAN SPECIFICS:
    11. "TEB" (taxable equivalent basis) is Canadian reporting convention
    12. "Trading products" or "Markets" may combine multiple activities
    13. "Client-driven" emphasized to show not proprietary
    14. May combine with securities services or prime brokerage
    15. Less granular FICC/Equities split than US banks
    
    REMEMBER:
    - Trading = market-making, client execution, spread capture
    - NOT = advisory fees, underwriting, lending margins, asset management
