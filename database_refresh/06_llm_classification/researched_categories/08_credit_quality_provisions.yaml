    When classifying content as Credit Quality & Provisions:
    
    CORE IDENTIFICATION:
    1. Look for LOAN LOSSES and CREDIT RISK discussion
    2. Key metrics: Provisions, charge-offs, NPLs, reserves
    3. Forward-looking (provisions) and backward-looking (charge-offs)
    4. Critical risk metric for lending businesses
    5. Directly impacts earnings through provision expense
    
    KEY COMPONENTS:
    6. Provision: Expense taken for expected losses
    7. Charge-offs: Actual losses realized
    8. Reserves/Allowance: Balance sheet cushion
    9. NPLs: Non-performing/impaired loans
    10. Delinquencies: Early warning indicators
    
    CRITICAL METRICS:
    - PCL/Provision = Income statement expense
    - NCO = Net charge-offs (charge-offs - recoveries)
    - ACL = Allowance (balance sheet reserve)
    - NPL = Non-performing loans
    - Coverage = Reserves / NPLs or Loans
    
    FRAMEWORKS:
    US BANKS (CECL):
    - Current Expected Credit Losses
    - Life of loan provisions
    - Day 1 reserves
    - Forward-looking
    
    CANADIAN BANKS (IFRS 9):
    - Three-stage model
    - Stage 1: Performing (12-month ECL)
    - Stage 2: Underperforming (lifetime ECL)
    - Stage 3: Impaired (lifetime ECL)
    - PCL on performing vs impaired
    
    PORTFOLIO SEGMENTS:
    - Consumer: Cards, mortgages, auto, personal
    - Commercial: C&I, CRE, leveraged loans
    - Geographic: Domestic vs international
    
    ECONOMIC SENSITIVITY:
    - Unemployment drives consumer losses
    - GDP impacts commercial losses
    - Home prices affect mortgage losses
    - Scenarios and probability weighting
    
    CYCLE DYNAMICS:
    - "Normalization" = returning to average
    - Through-the-cycle vs point-in-time
    - Vintage/cohort performance
    - Seasoning effects
    
    EXCLUSIONS:
    - Interest income (unless on impaired)
    - Trading losses (mark-to-market)
    - Operational losses
    - Securities gains/losses
    - Loan growth metrics
    
    REMEMBER:
    - This is about CREDIT RISK in lending
    - Both P&L impact (provisions) and balance sheet (reserves)
    - Leading indicator of bank health
    - Highly sensitive to economic conditions
    - Canadian PCL = US provisions (terminology difference)
