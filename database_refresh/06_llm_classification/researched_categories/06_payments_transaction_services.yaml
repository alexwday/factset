  prompt_guidance_for_llm: |
    When classifying content as Payments & Transaction Services:
    
    CORE IDENTIFICATION:
    1. Look for FEE-BASED transactional and processing services
    2. Key activities: payment processing, clearing, settlement, custody
    3. Volume-driven revenue model (not spread-based)
    4. Infrastructure and rails, not lending
    5. B2B and B2B2C services primarily
    
    KEY COMPONENTS:
    6. Merchant Services: Acquiring, processing, e-commerce
    7. Treasury Services: Payments, cash management, trade
    8. Securities Services: Custody, clearing, fund administration
    9. Cross-border: International payments, FX (operational)
    10. Digital: Wallets, real-time, blockchain payments
    
    REVENUE DRIVERS:
    - Transaction volumes (number and value)
    - Take rates (basis points on volume)
    - Per-transaction fees
    - Platform/subscription fees
    - Float income (not primary)
    
    GEOGRAPHIC DIFFERENCES:
    US BANKS:
    - JPM has separate "Payments" division
    - Citi has "TTS" (Treasury and Trade Solutions)
    - Often reported as distinct business
    - Focus on scale and technology
    
    CANADIAN BANKS:
    - Usually EMBEDDED in other segments
    - Not separately reported typically
    - "Moneris" is RBC/BMO merchant JV
    - Interac network for domestic
    - Less granular disclosure
    
    TECHNOLOGY FOCUS:
    - Real-time payments (RTP, FedNow, RTR)
    - API-based services
    - Blockchain/DLT experiments
    - Digital wallet integration
    - Payment modernization initiatives
    
    EXCLUSIONS:
    - Card lending (that's consumer banking)
    - Trading volumes (that's markets)
    - Retail banking fees (unless payment-specific)
    - Investment banking (different from transaction banking)
    - Basic deposits (that's commercial banking)
    
    REMEMBER:
    - This is about payment INFRASTRUCTURE and PROCESSING
    - Volume-based fees, not interest spreads
    - B2B focus (though affects B2C transactions)
    - Technology and scale are key differentiators
    - Canadian banks embed in other segments
