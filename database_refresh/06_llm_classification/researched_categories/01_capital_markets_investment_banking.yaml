  prompt_guidance_for_llm: |
    When classifying content as Capital Markets & Investment Banking:
    
    1. Look for FEE-BASED activities (not principal risk-taking or lending spreads)
    2. Focus on ADVISORY and UNDERWRITING services
    3. M&A advisory, DCM, and ECM are the core components globally
    4. League tables and wallet share indicate IB competitive position
    5. Backlog and pipeline refer to future IB revenue potential
    
    CANADIAN BANK SPECIFICS:
    6. "Capital Markets" segments often COMBINE IB with trading - look for fee language
    7. "Origination" typically means investment banking in Canadian context
    8. "Corporate and Investment Banking" is common Canadian terminology
    9. Canadian banks may not separate IB fees as clearly as US banks
    10. Cross-border (Canada-US) deals are commonly highlighted
    11. Syndication and arrangement fees are emphasized more than in US
    
    REMEMBER:
    - This is about helping clients raise capital or execute transactions
    - Focus on FEES not SPREADS (fees = IB, spreads = lending)
    - Exclude trading, lending margins, and principal investing
