  description: |
    Discussion of capital ratios, regulatory capital requirements, capital allocation, buybacks,
    dividends, and liquidity metrics. Includes CET1, Tier 1, leverage ratios, stress testing,
    and capital planning. Covers both regulatory minimums and management targets. Critical for
    assessing financial strength and capital deployment capacity.

    When classifying content as Capital & Liquidity:
    
    CORE IDENTIFICATION:
    1. Look for REGULATORY CAPITAL and LIQUIDITY discussion
    2. Key metrics: CET1, Tier 1, leverage ratio, LCR
    3. Capital allocation: buybacks, dividends
    4. Regulatory requirements and buffers
    5. Financial strength and stability metrics
    
    KEY COMPONENTS:
    6. Capital Ratios: CET1, Tier 1, Total, Leverage
    7. Capital Actions: Buybacks, dividends, deployment
    8. Regulatory: Requirements, buffers, stress tests
    9. RWA: Risk-weighted assets and optimization
    10. Liquidity: LCR, NSFR, HQLA, funding
    
    CRITICAL METRICS:
    - CET1 = Common Equity Tier 1 ratio
    - RWA = Risk-Weighted Assets
    - LCR = Liquidity Coverage Ratio
    - SCB = Stress Capital Buffer
    - G-SIB/D-SIB = Systemically important bank
    
    CAPITAL STACK:
    1. Common equity (highest quality)
    2. AT1/Preferred
    3. Tier 2/Subordinated debt
    4. TLAC/Bail-in debt
    
    GEOGRAPHIC DIFFERENCES:
    US BANKS:
    - Fed regulated
    - CCAR/DFAST stress testing
    - SCB framework
    - G-SIB surcharges
    
    CANADIAN BANKS:
    - OSFI regulated
    - D-SIB buffers
    - Domestic Stability Buffer
    - Capital floor
    - Generally higher CET1 targets
    
    CAPITAL ALLOCATION PRIORITIES:
    1. Organic growth
    2. Dividends (progressive)
    3. Buybacks (opportunistic)
    4. Acquisitions
    5. Excess return
    
    STRESS TESTING:
    - Severely adverse scenario
    - Post-stress minimums
    - Capital planning restrictions
    - Buffer requirements
    
    LIQUIDITY SPECIFIC:
    - LCR = HQLA / Net cash outflows
    - NSFR = Stable funding / Required funding
    - Funding mix and costs
    - Deposit stability
    
    EXCLUSIONS:
    - Credit quality/provisions
    - Operating capital/working capital
    - Capital markets (business line)
    - Capital expenditures (CapEx)
    - Human capital
    
    REMEMBER:
    - This is about FINANCIAL STRENGTH
    - Regulatory compliance is critical
    - Capital return capacity matters to investors
    - Both capital AND liquidity included
    - Forward-looking capital planning important
