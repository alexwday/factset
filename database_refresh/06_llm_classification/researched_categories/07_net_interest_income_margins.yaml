- name: "Net Interest Income & Margins"
  
  description: |
    Discussion of interest income, interest expense, net interest income (NII), and net interest
    margin (NIM). Includes asset yields, funding costs, deposit pricing, rate sensitivity, and
    balance sheet optimization. Core profitability metric for banking activities reflecting the
    spread between earning assets and funding costs.

    When classifying content as Net Interest Income & Margins:
    
    CORE IDENTIFICATION:
    1. Look for SPREAD between earning assets and funding costs
    2. Key metrics: NII, NIM, yields, funding costs
    3. Interest income minus interest expense
    4. Core banking profitability metric
    5. Rate environment impact on spreads
    
    KEY COMPONENTS:
    6. Income: Loan yields, securities yields, earning assets
    7. Expense: Deposit costs, wholesale funding, debt costs
    8. Net: NII (dollar amount), NIM (percentage)
    9. Sensitivity: Asset sensitive vs liability sensitive
    10. Optimization: Mix shift, pricing, duration
    
    CRITICAL METRICS:
    - NII = Net Interest Income (dollars)
    - NIM = Net Interest Margin (percentage)
    - Spread = Asset yield minus funding cost
    - Basis points (bps) = 0.01%
    - Deposit beta = deposit rate change / Fed rate change
    
    RATE ENVIRONMENT:
    - Rising rates: Generally helps if asset sensitive
    - Falling rates: Pressure if asset sensitive
    - Stable rates: Focus shifts to volume and mix
    - Yield curve shape impacts profitability
    
    GEOGRAPHIC DIFFERENCES:
    US BANKS:
    - Report NII and NIM prominently
    - Fed rate sensitivity discussed
    - Deposit franchise value emphasized
    
    CANADIAN BANKS:
    - Use TEB (taxable equivalent basis)
    - Discuss volume vs margin trade-off
    - Bank of Canada rate impact
    - More variable rate mortgages
    - Prime rate lending common
    
    BALANCE SHEET DYNAMICS:
    - Asset mix (loans vs securities)
    - Funding mix (deposits vs wholesale)
    - Fixed vs floating rate
    - Duration matching
    - Hedging strategies
    
    EXCLUSIONS:
    - Non-interest income (fees)
    - Trading revenues (unless trading NII)
    - Credit provisions (separate line)
    - Securities gains/losses
    - Operating expenses
    
    REMEMBER:
    - This is THE core banking metric
    - Spread business fundamentals
    - Every bank discusses this prominently
    - Rate environment is critical context
    - Volume AND margin both matter
