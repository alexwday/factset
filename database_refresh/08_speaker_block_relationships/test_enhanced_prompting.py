Test script for Enhanced Stage 8 Speaker Block Relationship Scoring

This script validates the enhanced prompting approach by testing various
speaker block relationship patterns and ensuring the improved context
dependency detection is working correctly.

Run this script to validate the enhanced implementation before deployment.
